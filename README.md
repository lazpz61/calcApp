Welcome to my Calculator Application

Calculator Application Description:

This repo primarily serves as a refresher for some of the basic principles for my knowledge retention and to revisit some of the earlier foundational concepts. It is also a part of a personal goal of mine to get back into the groove of coding, after being away from it after 3 months since May after graduating with my Masters in Software Development from Boston University. I was primarly coding in JAVA.  


Changes I Made that were not on the tutorial: 

There are certain elements of this Code that I have changed such as the JS logic for ensuring that no operator is being used twice in the event that a user presses an operator more than once. To ensure that the application behaves like a true calculator I applied regualr expressions into the condition for when a user presses the '=' button when trying to evaluate the calculation. 

Insturctions for code analying:

1. Clone Repository onto local machine/
2. Run utilizing a text editor of choice and run a live server to untiize the code

Deployment:

I've deployed this on Netlify and needed to add the index.php code to allow the Netlify to include the index.html as the course where to start with the deployment.

Enjoy!
