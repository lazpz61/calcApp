Welcome to my Calculator Application

Calculator Application Description:

This repor primarily serves as a refrsher for some of the basic principles for my knowledge retention and to revisit some of the earlier foundational concepts. It is also as part of a personal goal of mine to get back into the groove of coding, after being away from it after some time since May after graduating with my Masters from Boston University and primarly coding in JAVA. 


Changes I Made that were not on the tutorial: 

There are certain elements of this Code that I have changed such as the JS logic for ensuring that no operator is being used twice in the event that a user presses an operator more than once. To ensure that the application behaves like a true calculator I applied regualr expressions into the condition for when a user presses the '=' button when trying to evaluate the calculation. 

Insturctions for Usage:

1. Clone Repository onto local machine/
2. Run utilizing a text editor of choice and run a live server to untiize the code

Enjoy!
